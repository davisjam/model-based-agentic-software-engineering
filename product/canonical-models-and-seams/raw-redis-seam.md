# Sole raw-Redis seam (the dispatch module)

**Intent** — Confine *all* raw-Redis access to one module, with every queue key declared there, so the
queue's atomicity and schema invariants live in exactly one lint-enforced place.

| Summary | All raw Redis in one seam; queue atomicity encoded once. |
| Target | Product · **Canonical models & seams** |

| Enforcement | **Hard** (deterministic) · *blocking* — the sole-seam lint bans raw Redis outside the dispatch module |

*Its place in the environment — a **variant / known-use** of **One Door Enforced**, under **CONSTRAIN · Constrain where and how agents act**. Preserved here for its technical texture.*

## Motivation — the failure it kills

Raw Redis calls scattered across the codebase break two invariants at once. **Atomicity**: a
pop-and-move done as `ZPOPMIN` + `LPUSH` (two commands) **silently loses a job** if the worker crashes
between them. **Schema**: key names drift from the declared set, so a metric that reads queue depth
misses a structure. Both recur wherever someone reaches for the raw client.

## Why it's not just "call Redis where you need it"

Scattered raw Redis lets the **atomicity bug class recur** (every non-atomic pop-and-move is a
silent-job-loss waiting for a crash) and lets key names drift from the schema until a depth metric
reads the wrong structures. The dispatch module is the **sole raw-Redis seam**: all keys are declared
there, atomic pop-and-move is encoded once (Lua `EVAL` for sorted sets, `RPOPLPUSH` for lists), and a
lint bans raw Redis elsewhere. Can a convention guarantee no one ever writes a two-command pop-and-move?
It cannot: the next caller who reaches for the raw client re-risks the silent loss. A typed seam that
encodes atomicity and schema in one place can, because there is no other place to write the bug.
Centralizing is also what makes "a queue-depth metric must query *all* queue structures" enforceable at
all.

## Mechanism

The dispatch module is the one raw-Redis surface; all queue keys are declared in its schema (a flat
re-export name exists as a transitional shim). Pop-and-move is atomic (Lua for ZSETs, `RPOPLPUSH` for
lists), never `ZPOPMIN` + `LPUSH` as two commands. A sole-seam lint bans raw Redis outside the module.

## Prerequisites

- **A single module owning Redis** and a **declared key schema** it is the source of truth for.
- **Atomic operation primitives** (Lua / `RPOPLPUSH`) so pop-and-move can't be two commands.
- **A sole-seam lint** banning the raw client elsewhere.

## Consequences & costs

- **All Redis funnels through one seam** — a coupling point that must cover every queue operation.
- **Transitional debt.** The flat re-export shim for the key schema is a name to eventually retire.
- **The seam must keep pace** with new queue structures, or callers are tempted back to raw access.

## Known uses

- The dispatch module (sole raw-Redis seam) + the queue-key schema.
- Atomic pop-and-move (Lua `EVAL` for ZSETs, `RPOPLPUSH` for lists).
- The sole-raw-Redis-seam lint.

## Related mechanisms

- *See also (sibling)* — [service-client](service-client.md): the same `bounded-service` pattern for
  the cross-service-HTTP boundary: one lint-enforced seam owning a dangerous class of raw calls.
- **Counterpart** — the sole-seam lint (hard) that bans raw Redis outside the dispatch module.
